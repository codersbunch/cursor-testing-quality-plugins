description: Performance standards and anti-patterns to avoid in application code
alwaysApply: true

performance-standards:

- Never execute database queries inside loops - use batch queries or JOINs
- Paginate all list endpoints - never return unbounded result sets
- Cache expensive computations and repeated external API calls
- Use database indexes for all columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses
- Avoid synchronous blocking operations in async/event-loop code
- Profile before optimizing - measure first, then fix the actual bottleneck
- Use connection pooling for all database and HTTP connections
- Lazy-load heavy resources - don't load what you don't need upfront
- Set timeouts on all external calls (HTTP, DB, cache)
